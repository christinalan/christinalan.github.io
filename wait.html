        The version you are testing simulates the live version, where your
        presence becomes interwoven with others who have joined the room. Your
        presence takes the form of an audio frequency. In the live version, you
        are given the chance to choose your frequency avatar by picking from
        this page's audio clock.
        <u
          >In this solo version, you will be given a random frequency in the
          shape of a squiggly line to represent "you."</u
        >
        Throughout the experience, more frequencies will enter the room,
        mimicking our eventual awareness of others who inhabit a shared space
        despite our initial solitude. <br />

        <b>About</b> <br /><br />
        Welcome to nonclub. It is a room in passing, created in part due to the
        pandemic's impact on spaces that have been essential to the mental
        health of many. The loss of underground clubs, particularly those that
        evoke a realm of temporal and liminal possibility, has removed critical
        channels of release and transformative experimentation.
        <br />
        <br />This piece has two versions: solo and live, but currently only
        works as a solo experience. Neither experience attempts to replicate the
        experience of going to an underground club. Instead, they serve as
        respites that have the potential to exist beyond the pandemic. This
        piece is an interruption, a break from the increased ubiquity of digital
        interactions and an alternative to forming new connections. In the full
        live version, users will also be able to upload their own recordings to
        generate a unique sonic gathering.
