          The version you are testing simulates the live version, where your
          presence becomes interwoven with others who have joined the room. Your
          presence takes the form of an audio frequency. In the live version,
          you are given the chance to choose your frequency avatar by picking
          from this page's audio clock. However, in this solo version, you will
          be given a random frequency that resembles a squiggly line to
          represent "you." As you journey through, other frequencies will enter
          the room, mimicking our eventual awareness of others who inhabit a
          shared space despite our initial solitude.
          <br /><br />
          1. Please use headphones. Direct your mobile to
          <a href="cn.html">this URL</a> and start the background audio. It does
          not need to be fully audible throughout. Place your phone behind you
          or somewhere not beside you (skip if you're not alone). <br /><br />2.
          Click buttons as they appear. <br /><br />3. Hover your mouse over new
          visual stimuli. Audio and visual cues will guide you throughout.
          Listen intently to the various sounds. <br /><br />
          4. PLEASE SCROLL SLOWLY & TAKE YOUR TIME! The experience will last up
          to 5 minutes.

          About <br /><br />
          Welcome to nonclub. It is a room in passing, created in part due to
          the pandemic's impact on spaces that have been essential to the mental
          health of many. The loss of underground clubs, those that evoke a
          realm of temporal and liminal possibility, has removed critical
          channels of undergoing release and transformative experimentation.
          <br />
          <br />This piece has two versions: solo and live, but currently only
          works as a solo experience. Neither attempt to replicate the
          experience of going to an underground club but instead, serve as
          respites that have the potential to exist beyond the pandemic. This
          piece is an interruption, a break from the increased ubiquity of
          digital interactions and an alternative to forming new connections. In
          the full live version, users will also be able to upload their own
          recordings to generate a unique sonic gathering.
