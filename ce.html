      Welcome to my research trail for my assigned topic: historical
      re-enactment. Research is currently presented in html format - one day I
      may make this more presentable and engaging.
    </p>

    <div class="description">
      I will admit that when first given this topic, I was not very enthused to
      research it further. I thought historical re-enactment only dealt with
      battles, colonial livelihoods, and global civil wars. Thankfully, due to
      the helpful library research guide, I quickly learned that historical
      re-enactment encompassed much more than a living history of wars. My
      research progression follows something like this:
      <br /><br />
      historical re-enactment > historical representation > technology’s effect
      on realistic representation > simulacrum (when is simulation more real
      than reality) > experiencing the past emotionally and somatically >
      opportunities for addressing trauma > body-based testimony > open-ended
      history in relation to a passionate present
      <br /><br />

      I’ve broken down my research by identifying key terms, questions, cautions
      during research, and potential sub-topics. I’ve also included a section of
      notes from the simulation reading (Simulacra and simulation) that have
      guided parts of my research. Finally, I’ve added a few of the readings
      I’ve done, as well as any notes I had for them.

    <p class="titlepost">Questions</p>
    <div class="description">
      How do we know what the past smelled, tasted, sounded, felt like? <br />
      What is the relationship between realism and authenticity? <br />
      When can reenactment be used as redemption? When should it be used as
      methodology? <br />
      Can a re-enactment operate like a simulation (which presumes virtual
      reality)? <br />
      How do simulations change the sequence of past, present, and future?
      <br />
      If the real is no longer what it is supposed to be, are re-enactments the
      closest we get to maintaining or producing a live / equitable simulacrum?
      <br />

      The As-If World or alternative past futures: (Hannah Arendt) “I could
      always have turned out differently. If we approached the study of history
      as a virtual/ video game simulation: at any point, there can be multiple
      outcomes. Implications for healing trauma and learning history
      <br />
      Present re-enactments - including past (present) re-enactments that help
      participants/historians develop a lived understanding of the studied
      group, is there a way to extend this acquired sympathy to current
      populations? A somatic learning of difference?

      Reconstructing landscapes/soundscapes that no longer have (or maybe never
      had) a reality to mimic. In the interests of pre-COVID nightlife, how
      might I reconstruct my experiences, my community’s collective memory to
      imagine and construct a new type of nightlife?

      Quotes: <br />
      "Why couldn't the "work" of the unconscious be "produced" in the same way
      as any other symptom in classical medicine? Dreams already are." <br />
      "Can one live with knowing everything is the distorted truth?" <br />
      “But their metaphysical despair came from the idea that the images
      concealed nothing at all, and that in fact they were not images, such as
      the original model would have made them, but actually perfect simulacra
      forever radiant with their own fascination.” <br />
      “The whole system becomes weightless; it is no longer anything but a
      gigantic simulacrum: not unreal, but a simulacrum, never again exchanging
      for what is real, but exchanging in itself, in an uninterrupted circuit
      without reference or circumference” <br />
      "Ideology only corresponds to a betrayal of reality by signs; simulation
      corresponds to a short-circuit of reality and to its reduplication by
      signs. It is always the aim of ideological analysis to restore the
      objective process; it is always a false problem to want to restore the
      truth beneath the simulacrum.” <br />
      <br />
      Is Disneyland a stand-in to confirm our perception of reality? A
      suspension of belief or disbelief? Acts of desperation that confirm our
      fragile hold of reality (theme parks, scandals, icons)
      <br />

      Evil things are upheld by moral superstructures! Power is a simulation
      <br />

      Revolving causality // Mobius strip - operational negativity // Order only
      understands reality (simulation is limited by order)
      <br />

      Is our confirmation of the real only bolstered by its opposite?
      <br />

      Real > reference (referential) > images/icons/signs > simulation
      <br />

      Real > neo real > hyperreal

          Body-based discourse <br />
          “Trauma, privation, emotional disturbance, and transformation leave
          their marks on the body and psyche, and it is to these wounds and
          scars that reenactors testify.” <br />
          versions of reliving history — “This emerges as a problem of
          representation: history is seen as an unassailable set of facts that
          awaits a good script.” “reenactment ought to make visible the ways in
          which events were imbued with meanings and investigate whose interests
          were served by those meanings. Reenactment's central epistemological
          claim that experience furthers historical understanding is clearly
          problematic: body-based testimony tells us more about the present self
          than the collective past.”

          point at their own limits. While the simulation (like science fiction)
          “extrapolates the future from an assumption (that is, potential),
          re-enactments always refer to concrete, past events (that is, actual).
          And whereas a simulation (in most cases) remains in virtual reality, a
          re-enactment by implication means translation into a real space with
          real objects and people” <br />

          What is the relationship between structure and agency when conducting

          Re-enactments should incorporate more reflexivity: placing modern

          “It is to dramatize the extent to which our knowledge of history is
          the outcome of a fragile investigative procedure. It can illustrate
          the extent to which history is an open, rather than a closed, body of
          knowledge - but one that has a real relationship with passionate
          present concerns at an individual level.” ---- history is not static
