        Your presence takes the form of an audio frequency. Currently, the
        frequency you choose from this page's audio clock will not follow you
        into the next room.
        <u
          >Instead, you will be given a random frequency that resembles a
          squiggly line to represent "you."</u
        >
        Throughout the experience, more frequencies will enter the room,
        mimicking our eventual awareness of others who inhabit a shared space
        despite our initial solitude. <br />
        <li>
          Please use headphones. This is a sonically-driven experience. Pause
          and listen intently to each sound that emerges.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Turn off the lights.</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Click buttons as they appear. Hover your mouse over new visual
          stimuli. Audio and visual cues will guide you throughout.

          SCROLL SLOWLY & TAKE YOUR TIME! The experience will last up to 5
          minutes.

        <b>About</b> <br /><br />
        Welcome to nonclub. It is a room in passing, created in part due to the
        pandemic's impact on spaces that have been essential to the mental
        health of many. The loss of underground clubs, particularly those that
        evoke a realm of temporal and liminal possibility, has removed critical
        channels of release and transformative experimentation.
        <br />
        <br />This piece does not attempt to replicate the experience of going
        to an underground club. Instead, it serves as a respite, one that has
        the potential to exist beyond the pandemic. It is an interruption, a
        break from the increased ubiquity of digital interactions and an
        alternative to forming new connections. Eventually, users will also be
        able to upload their own recordings to generate unique sonic narratives.
