          A simulation of underground club culture as a form of historical
          re-enactment
        </h3>
        <h5>
          The underground is a liminal space. Its existence is contingent on its
          nonexistence in outside reality, a befitting playground for
          reinvention. While the appearances of simulation and historical
          re-enactment differ, the search for meaning through bodily navigation
          remains the same. Historical re-enactment is a simulation, a
          conversation between an active past and a speculative future. Our
          memories are conduits for determining new ways of being.
          <br />
          <br />
          Underground club culture gives us the opportunity to explore how our
          body remembers. Devoid of fixity and permanence, the undoing of
          boundaries interlaces with a renewed sense of belonging. Possibilities
          become driven by perceptual experience, and we return yet again to
          these spaces to re-imagine how to live. This project is an attempt to
          recreate the underground's liminal playground through a stratified
          study of its unique conditions. With or without the context of a
          global pandemic, the hope for this project is to offer participants an
          opportunity to heal, reflect, and re-invent themselves through an
          experience of emancipatory possibility.

        This experience is best when used with headphones. Please settle into a
        space with limited distractions and enough room for movement or
        stillness. If you have multiple devices, you can trigger audio samples
        on each device for a more full-bodied experience.
