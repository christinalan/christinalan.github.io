      Welcome to my research trail for my assigned topic: historical
      re-enactment. Research is currently presented in html format - one day I
      may make this more presentable and engaging.

    <div class="description">
      I will admit that when first given this topic, I was not very enthused to
      research it further. I thought historical re-enactment only dealt with
      battles, colonial livelihoods, and global civil wars. Thankfully, due to
      the helpful library research guide, I quickly learned that historical
      re-enactment encompassed much more than a living history of wars. My
      research progression follows something like this:
      <br /><br />
      historical re-enactment > historical representation > technology’s effect
      on realistic representation > simulacrum (when is simulation more real
      than reality) > experiencing the past emotionally and somatically >
      opportunities for addressing trauma > body-based testimony > open-ended
      history in relation to a passionate present
      <br /><br />

      I’ve broken down my research by identifying key terms, questions, cautions
      during research, and potential sub-topics. I’ve also included a section of
      notes from the simulation reading (Simulacra and simulation) that have
      guided parts of my research. Finally, I’ve added a few of the readings
      I’ve done, as well as any notes I had for them.

      How do we know what the past smelled, tasted, sounded, felt like? <br />
      What is the relationship between realism and authenticity? <br />
      When can reenactment be used as redemption? When should it be used as
      methodology? <br />
      Can a re-enactment operate like a simulation (which presumes virtual
      reality)? <br />
      How do simulations change the sequence of past, present, and future?
      <br />
      If the real is no longer what it is supposed to be, are re-enactments the
      closest we get to maintaining or producing a live / equitable simulacrum?

      Quotes: <br />
      "Why couldn't the "work" of the unconscious be "produced" in the same way
      as any other symptom in classical medicine? Dreams already are." <br />
      "Can one live with knowing everything is the distorted truth?" <br />
      “But their metaphysical despair came from the idea that the images
      concealed nothing at all, and that in fact they were not images, such as
      the original model would have made them, but actually perfect simulacra
      forever radiant with their own fascination.” <br />
      “The whole system becomes weightless; it is no longer anything but a
      gigantic simulacrum: not unreal, but a simulacrum, never again exchanging
      for what is real, but exchanging in itself, in an uninterrupted circuit
      without reference or circumference” <br />
      "Ideology only corresponds to a betrayal of reality by signs; simulation
      corresponds to a short-circuit of reality and to its reduplication by
      signs. It is always the aim of ideological analysis to restore the
      objective process; it is always a false problem to want to restore the
      truth beneath the simulacrum.” <br />

      Interview with Sarah Hakani (curriculum development) on VR simulations for
      teaching Syrian refugee caretakers and physicians
    </p>
    <div class="description">*edited and condensed for clarity</div>
    <br />

    <div class="description">
      <div id="christina">
        C: To start off, can you tell me more about the masters program you were
        doing and your area of focus?
      </div>
      <div>
        <br />
        S: Yeah! In my masters program, I was in the Harvard school of education
        and my program was in technology and innovation. During that time I
        worked with this professor named Chris Dede. Chris’s area of focus is on
        VR and immersive learning experiences and the potential they have for
        things like language-learning and anything that would support
        marginalization,like constructing study-abroad experiences in VR rather
        than having people travel. Chris introduced me to Richard Mollica, who
        worked at the Harvard program in refugee trauma. He was working on the
        generative power of VR and immersive mobile apps that train people in
        ways that take their trauma background into account, and helps them
        re-generate empathy. Richard’s research was on how Syrian caregivers
        also have empathy burnout similar to Syrian refugees. He looked into how
        trauma often mirrors from recipient to caregiver and all the ways in
        which vicarious trauma makes the experience look the same in both of
        their brains. He and I talked about what it would look and feel like to
        construct experiences and immersive mobile apps that would help mitigate
        that, reverse that, and regenerate hope and empathy.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div id="christina">
        C: Did you have an interest in VR simulation before this project?
      </div>
      <div>
        <br />
        S: I think in a very hypothetical way, yes, but it was something I
        thought was just a cool thing, but couldn’t really be “my cool thing.”
        It started with the Dede asking me to see this exhibit at MIT museum, so
        I went to the exhibit called The Enemy, and it was essentially a VR
        exhibit, where you walk through and meet soldiers from different sides
        of the same battle. For example, an Israeli IDF soldier and a Palestinan
        child throwing rocks at tanks. The VR simulation tracks your eye
        movements, monitors your body language, and they take a survey pre-VR
        experience and post to see how your perceptions have changed, or how
        your perceptions evolved based on the amount you were able to empathize.
        What mine showed was that my bias beforehand was extremely pro-Palestine
        and the simulation itself was created for me to reflect hearing from the
        Israeli soldier about their experience of loss. Throughout the hour and
        a half that me and this person were talking, I was able to look at him
        more, I was able to ask questions back, and see that person as more of a
        human. It made me think about what it meant to be able to challenge core
        beliefs. And it’s a negative and scary effect of being able to learn
        that, but it’s also a very expansive and helpful one to be able to in
        this immersive conversion that isn’t real but is real. After that, my
        interest in (VR) became real rather than theoretical.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div id="christina">
        C: With that experience in mind, were you already researching Syrian
        refugees and caretakers, and somehow that came together in this new
        project?
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: At the time, I wasn’t really researching anything about caretakers.
        It had been left out of the equation for me until Richard put that into
        the equation. Previously I had been thinking about the impacts of trauma
        on language-learning. In undergrad, I did a lot of research on what it
        meant for people more from a neuroscience perspective, where the parts
        of your brain that are occupied by trauma make it a lot harder to
        multitask, harder to switch between languages, harder to inherit new
        languages and when you’re being taught in English and your mother-tongue
        is Arabic, it’s much harder for someone who has trauma to learn than it
        is for someone who doesn’t and is just coming from a different
        linguistic background. I was very curious about the extension of that
        into VR and language-learning for refugees and with the caregiver
        element added, the more that I researched I realized the power of
        vicarious trauma is also so strong and heavy. What happens when the
        people who are supposed to give care to these very traumatized
        populations also lose their ability to do so? It felt like a very
        different layering of issues that drew my attention to thinking about
        how trauma gets mirrored and what types of ways that community
        trauma-bonding are small subsets of this kind of caregiver and victim
        dynamic.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div id="christina">
        C: That’s a whole different element added to it. I’m curious about the
        project itself, what were the tools that were used? How did you find
        participants? How did you measure the mirrored reactions or similarity
        in trauma?
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: What I did was mostly the research to fund and ground the project.
        After this one year masters, Richard was going to go to Syria again and
        begin to implement these training tools and build out the training in a
        virtual environment, like seeing someone’s hand blown off. What do you
        do in that situation when you know it’s not real, but you have that
        proximity to it feeling very real. We developed several scenarios that
        could potentially be of use in this virtual environment and we’re
        working with a designer, marking how each of those experiences could be
        statistically significant and different from other experiences in terms
        of how it would feel to watch someone weep about losing a loved one
        versus watching someone come in and have lost a part of their body
        versus someone who has come in and lost a sense of self and fear. What I
        created was mostly literature review, the basis, everything we needed
        for funding, and mockups for what those scenarios would look like to
        then work with a designer to create a responsive app that would help
        them modulate throughout the training and reflect along the way.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div id="christina">
        C: Does the app envision that caretakers and those directly affected by
        trauma work together?
      </div>
      <div>
        <br />
        S: The app we illustrated was strictly for caregivers and that was
        partially because of the way funding models came through, but the ways
        that we decided to do that were all through Robert’s theory that if the
        caregivers do have this regenerated empathy and understand the tools
        that you might need for that, then it might lead to a responsive
        classroom style, like “I understand this, therefore I’m able to practice
        it with you better.” In phase one (which is what we were creating), it
        was just supposed to be for caregivers, and phase two, three, four would
        look like a more collaborative and responsive approach.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div id="christina">
        C: How did you stumble upon the idea that caregivers are maybe
        subconsciously affected by trauma?
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: That was a question that Robert asked, like “I have this theory, do
        you think it’s true?” We read a lot about physicians in general and what
        empathy burnout looks like and how it's embedded in so much of this
        work: lose a sense of self, lose a connection with this patient, and
        then you’ll be able to serve them. I found research on the ways that
        medical school is a breeding ground for empathy burnout and the ways
        they talk about empathy can be very in-theory only. There was this piece
        that said by the third year of medical school, physicians would have an
        80% decline in their empathic potential. I was measuring the many
        different ways they were being told what they’re doing, why they’re
        doing, and that they need to have tough skin. I looked up different
        training models for caregivers and found a similarity in many
        caregivers, especially those that are in these environments who either
        couldn’t handle it or didn’t feel it anymore. We got closer to the
        essence of what it means for someone to lose empathy for the person
        they’re serving.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div id="christina">
        C: It makes me think that these fields prioritize using methodology of
        written research at the risk of being super theoretical. Considering the
        study of emotion and body-based testimony, how does having actual
        physiological responses to these types of simulation have the potential
        to sustain empathy rather than something that’s experienced
        “in-the-moment”?
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: I think that part of it is the safety of being removed - the safety
        of knowing you’re in a simulation can help the extension of this, the
        part two of this. Say you were to put a Syrian refugee whose house was
        completely taken from them, crushed, and their daughters were killed in
        front of them and recreate it in a virtual simulation. They’re allowed
        to have a little more control in that situation and process in a way
        that’s not completely unwritten from their mind. I could see the safety
        of that recreation in many senses act as a trigger but I think those
        triggers, by allowing a physiological response without those things
        happening to you again have a lot of potential. I think the issue is
        with people like physicians, it’s not so much that they can’t experience
        this in a real environment - I think the issue is we’ve done so much
        damage to our emotional capacities that in some ways VR feels like an
        opportunity to redo it that feels real-ish, but can potentially reverse
        the damage of traditional schooling, burnout, and ways of saying,
        “You’re becoming a doctor because it’s good for family,” rather than
        “You’re becoming a doctor because it’s good for people.” VR gives you a
        chance to backpedal a bit and imagine futures but also recreate pasts of
        all of these blunders and when I was thinking about these third-year med
        students having lost their empathy, I thought “well it would be great if
        they could regenerate it somehow.”
      </div>
      <br />
      <div id="christina">
        C: We associate virtual reality and hyperreality as being so removed
        from real emotions to the point that we ask ourselves, “what is real?”
        How is it that we’re able to reintroduce lost emotions? With regard to
        agency and giving these participants agency, how do you also work in
        enough structure to help guide these people to re-experience these
        emotions they may have lost? For those who have experienced trauma, how
        do you ensure that they have enough agency and safety throughout? Do you
        have a guide for that?
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: I think it’s a very work-in-progress guide and I’d be happy to reach
        out to the lab about where this is currently but because we were
        thinking about it from the perspective of physicians, we weren’t
        thinking so much about how to protect these people from the traumas they
        have experienced, more so how to open them up to the traumas they often
        neglect. The reason they wanted to have a responsive mobile app was in
        order to help with that modulation in real-time where it's kind of like
        those talk-based therapies where you talk to yourself almost and helps
        you regulate yourself. That was kind of the idea when it's like you're
        in this environment, you’re in this experiment but there's consistent
        feedback because there is this talking to self AI responding that helps
        the researchers collect data on how safe it is and what is the impact
        it's having so I think the environment for success and environment for
        safety looks very different when it's physicians versus like refugees
        and so in this one case this responsive of mobile app was the solution
        that they had proposed.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div id="christina">
        C: Does something like this require conditioning or multiple, repeat
        immersions of the simulation?
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: I think the goal is to find one simulation that does it and I
        continue to think about The Enemy as an option for that. The Enemy was
        an opportunity for me to be in this environment and reflect on it now,
        three years later. I'm thinking a lot about that immersive experience -
        of course it didn’t change my mind but it stuck with me for many years
        in terms of how I think about war or how I even think about gang
        violence or how I think about issues that I feel very stern on and get
        to think about how the interpersonal differs from the state level.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div id="christina">
        C: Do you feel like the exhibit led you into that position? How much
        choice did you feel like you had throughout it and were there things
        that surprised you about yourself and was that separate from thinking
        that the simulation had a clear agenda?
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: Yes! That reminded me that I had a lot of choices throughout the
        experiment. There were three pairs that you can talk to that are on
        different sides of different wars and battles and I still stuck with the
        Israeli soldier for a really long time. I was asked by that person in
        the VR if I wanted to go talk to someone else and I just wanted to
        continue talking to the soldier. The choices that were made felt a
        little bit primed going into it because the survey beforehand asked,
        “How do you feel about Israel and Palestine?” I kept tricking my brain,
        thinking “Oh, this person is being really nice to you because you said
        you were pro-Palestine.” I do feel like I was primed but at the same
        time they did give you a lot of choice: some people walked through the
        exhibit in 20 minutes and I was in there for 2 and 1/2 hours, talking to
        that Israeli soldier for 1 and 1/2 hours and everyone else for 30
        minutes. And that all felt like a lot of choice. They're not rushing you
        through this experience: you take what you need and that experience
        makes me think that this doesn’t always need repeat exposures and I
        don’t think that many things do. If we strip it down to the most human
        sense, there have been conversations that have changed lives and I think
        that the past shouldn’t be unwritten through a VR world just because
        it’s technical and an experiment that might need multiple doses. There
        have been such singular experiences that are so transformative that I
        think the goal would be to create a singular experience rather than to
        force someone through an experiment. The closest you can get to humanity
        the better. When someone’s a lab rat and they're just pushed into this
        and are going to come out of it feeling more “blank,” more kind, more
        equipped - I think it takes you away from the initial goal, which is to
        re-embed humanity into you, rather than, ”let me show you the ways you
        can perform humanity.”
      </div>
      <br />

      <div id="christina">
        C: I think this experiment paired with you was a great match because
        you’re someone who has taught yourself through all your experiences of
        getting to know other people and through your research to have this
        approach of “I am going to try to understand perspectives that I don’t
        already.” That’s not something everyone already has built-in as a habit.
        I'm just wondering how that can be incorporated into schools. From an
        early age, something like this could be really helpful for people who
        don’t interact on a daily basis with marginalized populations or anyone
        of difference.
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: That's when I get really excited about the K-12 implications of it
        and the ways that VR has the potential to introduce communities to new
        communities without doing harm to other communities. Shared Studios was
        almost doing this except that it was invoking harm because it was real
        experience with another community. But if the Shared Studios model
        existed as simulations of people rather than people that you can
        voluntourism around, that could be really interesting too. The ways that
        we are taught to generate empathy through serving the marginalized
        rather than learning about the marginalized and understanding the
        marginalized could be subverted in a really cool way in VR. It’s
        learning about rather than entering the community and pick up the trash.
        There are a lot of implications in terms of what it could mean, even
        putting people in conversations that their friends wouldn’t bring them
        into - different social groups to be met where you are, to really
        understand that it’s not “oh my sister is just a hippie.” A lot of
        people resonate with wanting to have a conversation with someone like
        them that’s not them. Creating this simulation that shows the different
        types of people you could get to know that represent different types of
        people on Earth could be really helpful in even mending familial
        dynamics. It’s the same with the physicians. You don’t need to learn the
        skills to pretend you’re listening, you could just learn how to listen.
      </div>
      <br />

      <div id="christina">
        C: Do you think it’s important to have that environment knowing that
        you’re entering something that is supposedly not real? All these
        opportunities to repair certain relationships or to learn about other
        people - that seems like it requires a lot of time and energy into using
        the equipment that already makes you feel displaced. If we really want
        to introduce this to someone and the benefits are substantial, at what
        point does that become intrusive?
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: The whole element about at what point does it become intrusive is a
        very 2020 thought, but a past of immersion and a future of immersion
        aren’t intrusive. I feel like it's not intrusive to actively mend
        through a technology that’s an extension of sitting at a table and
        saying “Mom, I want to talk to you.” There's a world in which this can
        be such an embedded way of coping, of healing, and of really learning
        about difference in a way that makes a lot of things pains superfluous.
        Currently, it's really hard to think about how this wouldn’t be very
        intrusive or require a lot of priming and or wouldn't require a lot of
        after care. That is part of the issue with VR being reactive rather than
        reinstating humanity. If we decided today that the purpose of VR was to
        reinstate humanity, it wouldn’t have to be reactive. It could just be to
        teach humanity, understand one another, to learn empathy from a young
        age and learn the ways to modulate it yourself so you’re not burnt out
        and reaching for something to learn how to feel again. There’s a future
        world where it’s not an extension of you but just a part of how you
        learn.
      </div>
      <br />

      <div id="christina">
        C: It’s exciting that a lot of historians and some teachers are talking
        about the potential for lived or experimental history where there’s
        always a continuous connection between the past and the present. How can
        we reference the past in a way that honors our current bodies, and
        doesn’t just displace us in a previous body or another body somewhere
        else on this planet?
      </div>
      <div>
        <br />
        S: Sometimes that’s the coolest thing: your past evolves every day and
        thinking about history as a fixed thing is also something that this VR
        world would like to disrupt. A history could be completely rewritten
        through one conversation, similar to how history could be rewritten
        through one immersion, one interaction in that world. I think a future
        world acknowledges that every day, every hour, you are a new body and
        that new body has learned these things. You can learn something and it
        could just fit into your system of other things you’ve learned and it
        doesn’t have to disrupt everything because you are a new body. What does
        it mean for current selves and past selves to coexist without them
        hurting one another?
      </div>

      <br />

      <div id="christina">
        C: I’ve been thinking a lot about alternate past futures, which comes
        from a video game standpoint, where the game acknowledges that the
        player has a multitude of paths they can follow even if the game is a
        re-enactment of something from history. Keeping this multitude of
        alternate realities in mind, from our class reading, Baudrillard argues
        that our reality has become transformed into references, images, and
        icons that have assumed a reality behind them when in fact there’s
        nothing left to reference. In this view, everything is a simulation.
        Does this theory change your perspective?
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: My initial quick thought is that I don’t agree with it. Everything
        isn’t a simulation, but there can be many pasts and many futures. They
        can all be real. What you shared about alternate past futures is very
        resonant because there are so many branches of where things could have
        gone and while I’m on one of them, all of the other ones are still real
        and are ways I could have processed my histories. That in itself gives
        room to say one immersive experience or conversation can shift you on
        another branch of your past path. We have an arbitrary number of paths
        that any path can branch onto and some people might say that it makes
        none of them real, but you could be on any of those paths and our
        potential to grow, change, evolve, understand, re-evaluate, re-name,
        re-consolidate information in our brains differently. The more we can
        remember those pasts, the more we’re able to say “this is the new
        offshoot of it.” I don’t think alternate past futures means you’re on a
        different path you could’ve been on, but more so that you could’ve
        easily jumped. We’re so malleable that we can remember a past that we
        thought we had forgotten or that wasn’t real. We can heal in a different
        way. I feel really connected to reality and that’s also part of my fear
        of “it’s all fake.” I do think there are possibilities of that but there
        are much stronger possibilities of us having lived so many more lives
        than we’re able to name and that those lives can lead to so many more
        lives than we’re able to process.
      </div>
      <br />

      <div id="christina">
        C: Maybe it’s semantics, but if reality assumes the ultimate truth, one
        ideal life, and if we actually have all these iterations of life we
        could experience, then those iterations uphold the idea that everything
        is a simulation.
      </div>

      <div>
        <br />
        S: Yes! Both can be true - I will just panic about it. But, I think that
        the ways people often think about “everything is a simulation” is so
        watered down. It’s easier to say “everything is a simulation” to mean
        “I’m completely disconnected from my reality” rather than saying “I am
        so deeply interwoven with my reality.” Rather than saying “I contain
        10,000 pasts,” it’s easier to say “everything is fake.”

      With all this new information, I had to mull over what I wanted to create
      over a long(ish) run. I wanted everything I had learned to connect to my
      current preoccupations with nightlife and community. After answering the
      question about which imagination I felt trapped in, I thought about how
      the pre-COVID nightlife has quickly become an experience of the past. How
      might I communicate or re-animate that club essence (a thing I've been
      trying ever since Shanghai)? <br />
      My thought process from topic to project idea went something like this:
      <br />
      Historical re-enactment > lived history > living history > living
      re-enactment > DJing is keeping past music alive, re-animating past
      creations > remix = infinite alterations > past flowing into present >
      clubs are living re-enactments
      <br />
      <li>How can I describe to someone my connection to nightlife?</li>
      <li>
        What would this re-construction of my elation in Shanghai and Shanghai
        adjacent (not referring to physical location, but the type of experience
        felt) look like?
      </li>
      <div>
        I started out by taking a live mix from a night that captured that
        essence: playing b2b with someone I hope to play with and collaborate
        with indefinitely. Then, I chopped it up according to the most memorable
        (sometimes very messy) transitions and fed it to an Octatrack, a live
        sequencer. While I could have easily done this in a DAW, I really wanted
        to mimic the feel of DJing with equipment and the Octatrack makes
        sampling so tangible. After re-creating a mix from those samples, I then
        went ahead and chopped it up within Ableton. I fed those resulting
        samples to the Octatrack. I repeated the process about three times and I
        have those recordings below. It was an experiment to see what iterations
        and re-enactments could look like with soundscapes. While I had hoped
        that I would be able to reverse the process, I doubt it would ever come
        close to the original (re: Jean Baudrillard). It's not perfect, and I
        doubt anyone would want to listen to iteration 1, 2, or 3, but the
        process itself is something I want to continue exploring.

        In order to visualize and understand my connection between historical
        re-enactment and club simulations, I began making causal diagrams. These
        causal diagrams illustrate the idea of "club culture as re-enactment"
        more than re-enactment of club culture. The ideas outlined in this show
        how different parties become environments for active experimentation in
        not just the most visible parts of raving (people, style, lighting), but
        also the ways in which people connect with strangers, learn new ways of
        becoming (as well as overcoming past traumas or anxieties), and allow
        for difference to supersede the mainstream. In thinking about Morgan's
        essay on re-performance and Small's proposal for Musicking, I wanted to
        demonstrate how DJs (I'd argue are also performers) guide re-enactment,
        either through experimentation or preservation of ongoing club genres.
        What conditions are needed for the DJ to re-work the way we feel
        incentivized to move our bodies? And for dancers (also performers), how
        does irregular movement or freedom of movement allows us to re-shape
        (even if temporarily) the ways societal norms are hardcoded into our
        bodies?

        This helped me create a concept map for the club system or "lifeworld,"
        which is a term lovingly adapted from Fiona Buckland's
        <i>Impossible Dance</i>. It's pretty straightforward, and includes the
        various stakeholders in this system, but it wasn't a map that led to
        many 'aha's' that would help me gain new insights on this chosen path.

        For deeper clarification, I created two diagrams that better connected
        my research and thoughts on club culture as historical re-enactment as
        simulation. While I'm still thinking through the connections between the
        various nodes, I am seeing new possibilities for creating a guide.

    <div class="description">
      I spent much of the past week researching simulation, performance, and
      re-enactment in the form of club-specific contexts. I found really good
      resources that connected bodies on the dancefloor (club lifeworlds) to
      memory reconstruction and socio-political transformations that carried on
      from past to present, club to outside the club. In particular, historical
      re-enactment's emphasis on body-based discourse to uncover and formulate
      new meanings (either missed or impossible to determine through other
      methods) is evident in musical performance. Coined "Musicking," Small
      defines any instance of musical performance to include all ways of taking
      part, whether that's performing, listening, practicing, providing
      material, or dancing. Fiona Buckland took this idea of dancefloor
      participation to introduce club environments as pathways for
      worldbuilding, especially among queer individuals. Another idea I was
      especially intrigued by was connecting underground nightlife to
      experimental theater and playgrounds (play-reality). These ephemeral and
      liminal zones become laboratories of the present, allowing participants to
      embody action and historiography in order to construct new experiences and
      new meaning. In other words, "a pathway towards a way of 'being in the
      world' that resists fixity, embraces possibilities and offers the promise
      of mutuality."
