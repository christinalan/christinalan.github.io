        Hello, you are about to enter a virtual radio plaza.<br /><br />
        In this world, sonic artists who primarily work with radio will stream
        their signal transmissions and/or compositions into the space.<br />
        As a listener participant, you are encouraged to navigate the landscape,
        where info about the artist's broadcast location, signals captured, and
        equipment used will be displayed.<br /><br />The animations are
        audio-reactive and respond differently according to frequency and
        arbitrary user interaction. This platform is intended for those
        unfamiliar with software-defined radio and electromagnetic fields to
        cultivate an interest in exploring radio. To develop signal sense is to
        see into wireless connectivity, and to propose material cognizance of a
        technologically monolithic world.
      </p>
      <br />

<!-- These animations were developed in
conjunction with mapping out a personal understanding of wireless
connectivity and network topologies.  -->
