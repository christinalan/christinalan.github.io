      Welcome to my research trail for my assigned topic: historical
      re-enactment. Research is currently presented in html format - one day I
      may make this more presentable and engaging.

      I will admit that when first given this topic, I was not very enthused to
      research it further. I thought historical re-enactment only dealt with
      battles, colonial livelihoods, and global civil wars. Thankfully, due to
      the helpful library research guide, I quickly learned that historical
      re-enactment encompassed much more than a living history of wars. My
      research progression follows something like this:
      <br />
      historical re-enactment > historical representation > technologyâ€™s effect
      on realistic representation > simulacrum (when is simulation more real
      than reality) > experiencing the past emotionally and somatically >
      opportunities for addressing trauma > body-based testimony > open-ended
      history in relation to a passionate present
