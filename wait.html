          This website can be a solo or group experience, done on your own time
          or live with others. You are testing the standalone version, which
          simulates what could happen during a live session. In response to
          Space 10's call for pieces that prioritize mental health, this website
          is a stand-in for channels of release and connection many of us have
          lost, as well as an interruption to increased, habitual digital
          consumption. It pulls from underground club spaces in its attempts to
          emulate a realm of temporality and liminality. It is a journey hinged
          on anticipation, stillness, and auditory and tactile exploration.
          Before you enter, you are given an avatar in the shape of a sonic
          waveform. While this simulated version will not carry the frequency
          you choose in the following website, you will be given a frequency
          that acts as your avatar. As you move through the experience, other
          bodies (avatars) will emerge, mimicking the experience of a communal,
          live event.
          <br /><br />
          This experience is best with headphones and fully utilizes the
          affordances of a touchpad or mouse.The journey continues as one
          scrolls downwards and layers are revealed through visual prompts.
          Please 1) Click buttons as they appear 2) Hover your mouse over new
          visual stimuli. Audio and visual cues will guide you throughout.
          Lastly, please scroll SLOWLY and take your time.
