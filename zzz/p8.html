    <h1>P8 The Invisible Sounds Residency: <i>Quantum Needle</i></h1>
    <p>
      In the fall of 2021, I participated in
      <a href="https://www.plan8tair.com/residency">Plan8t's fall residency, </a
      >which focused on how an emphasis on sounds might inspire empathic
      connections to the environment. My work during this period focused on
      highlighting bird song and bird sensitivities to sounds that are
      imperceptible to human ears. Because of the remote nature of the
      residency, I built a speculative visual-soundscape in Three.js using
      samples of birds I recorded from Marine Park, NY and recordings of
      Changsha's subways stations, which were provided by P8. Documentation and
      full description of the work are as follows and a demo of the environment
      can be found <a href="https://magneto-reception.herokuapp.com/">here.</a>
    </p>

        Imperceptible to human ears, the signals detected from mobile networks
        and satellite messaging sound eerily like birds migrating above. While
        we become aware of overhead species through more overt signs of
        habitation (evidence occasionally perceived as bordering on intrusion),
        the invisibility of network and wireless infrastructure belies the
        existence of unfamiliar interference. <br /><br />
        Radio waves tell the story of insistent connectivity and cybernetic
        triumph, but also the status of the planet’s layers of land, water, and
        sky. While we use the electromagnetic spectrum to broadcast public
        programming, heat food, provide cell service, and transmit data, we are
        also able to use signals as a way to sense changes in the environment
        and its inhabitants. <br /><br />
        Birds in particular are sensitive to these movements in the
        electromagnetic spectrum. Already capable of detecting the Earth’s
        magnetic fields through magneto-receptors in their retinas and beaks,
        birds rely on this internal compass to migrate home. Intrigued by this
        sense, scientists have tested the effects of various electromagnetic
        fields on different species of birds. While still inconclusive, it is
        evident that certain migratory birds experience magnetic disorientation
        depending on the types of anthropogenic electromagnetic noise. By
        becoming more familiar with the electromagnetic spectrum through radio
        waves and other ways of listening, we may be able to pivot our senses to
        those of nonhuman kin. <br /><br />
        This speculative, audio-visual landscape contrasts invisible signal
        sound to bird song, framing the rare perspective of distinct bird
        species. Bridging the two geographical inspirations for the piece,
        sounds from field recordings of Monk Parakeets and Pigeons in New York
        City are paired with recordings of Lesser Coucals and Little Greebes in
        Changsha, China. The base layer of the world is composed of satellite
        imagery from NOAA-18 and textures of the dancing infrastructures build
        upon waterfall captures of recorded signals. These invisible wires are
        represented by recordings of electromagnetic energy throughout NYC as
        well as signals from sources that include 850 mHZ (3G) and 147 mHZ (used
        by US military). The movement and composition of both anthropogenic
        structures and birds-in-flight interact with one another, at times
        converging and other times clashing.<br /><br />
        Through this generative landscape-soundscape, viewers and listeners are
        invited to forge a new appreciation and connection with species in ways
        that counter their human-depicted narratives. In these spaces,
        participants listen to both the sounds that permeate the ether and the
        sounds of bird song. This conversation, one normally inaudible to the
        human listener, establishes an intimacy that is uniquely accomplished
        through a narration of sound. By hearing the chaotic mesh of advancing
        technology that non-human species physically endure, we can more
        regularly use signals as a way to become more attuned to the environment
        and to more critically understand the reality and future of invisible
        infrastructures.<br />
